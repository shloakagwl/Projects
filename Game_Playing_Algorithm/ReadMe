Code Structure
--------------
There are two file:
1.maxconnect4.py
It contains main part function. Basically it contains two mode: one-move mode and interactive mode. 
It contains 
+main function which reads the arguments and redirect to suitalble function according to mode.
+oneMoveMode function which take input file and computer computes the next turns and displays the game borad.
+interactiveMode functions depending who is the next turn is, it goes to humanPlay() or aiPlay().
+humanPlay function which takes the raw int input for the human player and checks wheather it is vaild move and changes the trun to computer.

2.MaxConnect4Game.py
It contains the all the supporting files that is minmax, alpha-beta, beta-aplha and eval function.
+checkPieceCount function checking if count the number of piece already played
+getPieceCount function returning the total piece of the borad which are occupied
+displayGB function display the game borad
+printGameBoardToFile function for printing the game borad to file
+playPiece function for placing the current player piece in the column
+checkPiece function for checking if the piece is valid or not
+maxVal function for resturing the state for the maximun value
+minVal function for returning the state for the minimun value
+alphaBeta function for alpha beta puring (max val)
+betaAlpha function for beta alpha puring (min val)
+minMax plain min max algorithm
+verticalCheck checking the vertical piece in the row
+horizontalCheck checking for the horizontal piece in the column
+diagonalCheck checking for the diagonal check in the borad
+streakCalc function for checking which type of connectfour goes
+playerEvalCalc calculating the streak for the non computer player
+evalFunc function for the which next color is 
+compEvalCalc calculating the streak for the computer
+evalCalc function for calucating the difference in the steak of computer vs non computer
+changeMove function for changing to next player 
+aiPlay function for computing the computer move
+scoreCount function for returning the score count i.e. fours in a row
