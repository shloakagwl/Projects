ML based project to estimate the height of human in a video surveillance using the tilt angle feature.
Image per frame were resize to 400x400 greyscale, then pass to HOG descriptor with SVM for classification. 
Image preprocessing was done to get the detection as accurate as possible. 
With help of geometric and trigonometric formula, tilted image was transformed to zero angle plane image depending upon parameters (reference height, detected pixel height and display resolution).
