Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if you can swap two letters in A so the result is equal to B, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at A[i] and A[j]. For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Constraints:

    0 <= A.length <= 20000
    0 <= B.length <= 20000
    A and B consist of lowercase letters.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of A and B.
