In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the ith domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

Constraints:

    2 <= A.length == B.length <= 2 * 10^4
    1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6
    
Time Complecity: O(n); n = lenght of A
