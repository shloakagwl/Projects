Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

    Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
    The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

 Constraints:

    m == matrix.length
    n == matrix[i].length
    0 <= m, n <= 100
    -10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4
    
Time Complexity: Binary search O(log m); m is length of col. in matrix
